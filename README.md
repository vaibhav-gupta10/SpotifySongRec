# SpotifyRecommender

SpotifyRecommender is a personalized song recommendation system developed using Spotify's music data. The project utilizes machine learning and data analysis techniques to generate song recommendations based on user preferences and listening history.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The project includes code for cleaning and transforming Spotify's music data to extract relevant features for analysis and modeling.

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Collaborative filtering techniques have been implemented to generate personalized song recommendations by leveraging user behavior and preferences.

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Content-based filtering algorithms have been developed to recommend songs similar to a user's favorite tracks or based on specific musical characteristics.

- **Evaluation and Performance Metrics**: The project includes evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy to assess the performance of the recommendation system.

- **Interactive User Interface**: A user-friendly interface has been built to allow users to interact with the recommender system and receive personalized song recommendations.
